Programming brain genius

"DJANGO IS A PIECE OF CRAP!"

"It's old!"

"It's got too many features!"

PERFORMANCE ISN'T EVERYTHING

- Maturity
- Stability
- Difficulty
- Community

Django has a huge community

There's always someone to help you!

Django comes with a LOT of features...

But you don't have to use them all

Debates about "the best framework in the world" are USELESS!
